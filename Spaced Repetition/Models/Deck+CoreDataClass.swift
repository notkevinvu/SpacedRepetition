public class Deck: NSManagedObject {
    
    /**
     A method to help with setting all the attributes of a newly initialized/added Deck object
     
     Use this method after creating a Deck object
     ```
     let deck = Deck(context: managedContext)
     
     deck.initializeDeckWithValues(name:...)
     ```
     
     - Parameters:
        - name: Should take in a string typically set through user interaction (alert controller text field)
        - deckID: Inject a UUID instance here (`UUID()`)
        - dateCreated: Likewise with `deckID`, inject a Date instance here (`Date()`)
        - deckIndex: Here, we should set the deckIndex by passing in the count of the current # of decks objects.
     By doing so, we can impose an order on how deck objects will be sorted when we fetch, rather than doing it by date created.
     This allows us to eventually re-order the decks by moving a deck and then updating the deckIndex of all other decks by matching it to its indexPath.row in the collection view.
     - Parameter cards: We pass in an array of cards which will then be added to the deck within the initializer.
